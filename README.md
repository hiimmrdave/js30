# Implementing JavaScript30
I'm posting my code of how I go about Wes Bos's JavaScript30 course, saving my work somewhere and holding myself accountable.

I'm only uploading code that I write myself. Files referenced from a "js30" directory are available from Wes's repository at https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30
