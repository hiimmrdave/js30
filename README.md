# Implementing JavaScript30

I'm posting my code of how I go about Wes Bos's JavaScript30 course, saving my work somewhere and holding myself accountable.

I'm only uploading code that I write myself. Files referenced from a "js30" directory are available from Wes's repository at <https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30>

## Progress

- 01-drumkit done 2/10/20
I built the html in a way that felt more semantic to me. The keyboard events are case sensitive using KeyboardEvent.key, which was intentional.
- 02-clock done several days ago, posted 2/25
I built the clock in SVG, and otherwise followed the recommendations from the course.
- 03-cssvars
I did this over the course of two days in between trying to cross-compile deno from fedora x86_64 to aarch64 (for raspberry pi). This was the first lesson I attempted in typescript.
- 04-arraycardio1, posted 3/9
I preferred arrow functions with implicit returns. I used more terse syntax than the course, but the solutions are generally pretty straightforward.
- 05-flexpanel, done 3/10 posted 3/11
I didn't add background images, just enough difference to get the effect. I also simplified the css a little.
